# CMD is the command that is executed when the container is started
# -g "daemon off;" - global directive, start in foreground
#   - by default nginx goes to the background (daemonized)
#   - Docker expects the main process (PID 1) to run in foreground
#   - if the process goes to the background - Docker will consider the container as stopped
#     and stop it
#   - daemon off; forces nginx to run as a foreground process
#   - now Docker sees that the process is alive and keeps the container running
